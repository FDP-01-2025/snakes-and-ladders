# 🎲 Snakes and Ladders v1.0: Game Introduction

## 🧩 Description

**Snakes and Ladders** is a classic board game that originated in ancient India and has since become a beloved pastime around the world. It is a game of chance, typically played by 2 or more players, and is suitable for all ages.

The board consists of a grid of numbered squares, usually from 1 to 100. Scattered across the board are **ladders**, which help players advance more quickly, and **snakes**, which send players backward. The objective is simple: be the first to reach the final square.

The game is not only fun but also teaches basic counting skills and introduces the concept of cause and effect in a playful way.
